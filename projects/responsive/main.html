                    <p>this is my father's face, he literally smile like this, so when I found this pictire, I just felt like I am home, but his skin is not this tend by the way.
                        I just miss his smile, we had so much fun back in my country. oh yeah, he is working in the constrution site, he does not look strong
                        but he can carry  very heavy stuff and working for like hours.

                    <p>This is not how my mom smile, but her eyes is big, just like the picture shows. She is also a 
                        constrution site worker, she is smaller than me but she can carry bery heavy stuff for like hours.
                        I don't know how she can work like this, but she has been working like that for years. I just really admire her hard work and effort for my family.

                    <p>My sister has a big mouth, just like this picture. She has three chiidren already, and they are all crazy
                        but I really miss them, they are the reason why I am homesick, the time is flying, and I think now they grow up.
                        which is a good thing but that also means that they are no longer cute. The cutest age for kid is before two years old.
                        once they pass this age, they are adult for me.
