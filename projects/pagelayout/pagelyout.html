        <p>OK. I don't know what to say, 
            <br>but I like playing guitar,but I did not like it at first, 
            <br>but I just gradually found out that I am actually 
            <br> good at it, then I start practice harder. 
            <br>Althought the process of practicing is still very boring 
            <br>and I give up a lot of time, but as long as I think about 
            <br>that I can impress some people I know that just encourage 
            <br>me to keep going, but anyway, I still paly it now.
